Simple generic shopping project built with medusa as the backend and nextjs as the frontend
A good exercise in some nextjs quirks and new features, along with learning to use tailwind for responsive styling
The steps to run this project are: 1. in the medusa-store directory, make a .env file with your values which fit a format similar to the one in .env.sample. After that, run either yarn install in the same directory and yarn seed, or go to the frontend directoy and run yarn setup along with yarn db (to achieve the same thing as seeding). Both build and ev functions can also be called individually or in parallel as defined in package.json of frontend. Possbily will add client side instead of ppr but that is subject to change. More stuff like carts and payment systems coming soon.
